PGE File Library
=======

This Library can read and write .lvl/.wld/.lvlx/.wldx files.

### Provided Libraries in this repo
This repo is split up into two parts:
 - "PGE File Library" for COM Technology
 - PGE Core Internal Library
 
#### "PGE File Library" for COM Technology
This one is recommend for beginners who want to write simple scripts with this library. This library however only works for windows but it can be used in a **lot of programming languages**! Here you can see the list of [supported languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLE_Automation#Language_support).

Because this is still WIP there is no release nor documentation released yet. 

#### PGE Core Internal Library
This is the C++ implementation written in pure STL. You can find the (still in WIP) library in /pgelib2015/PGEFile/PGEFile/Internal/

This library has no documentation yet.
