SMBX Port to 3DS!

- Crashes
  - Think through exceptions in standard library / PGE stuff

- Appearance glitches
  - Judder when Mario is on a conveyer belt
  - Judder when holding vegetable
  - MCZ judder
  - Improve rounding
    - Standard math round might be cheaper w optimizations
    - Sometimes tiled backgrounds desync (force them to round same way)
  - Bugs
    - Skeleton death anim (Hyrule temple)
    - Hammer bro death anim

- Performance
  - Saves
    - Load all files in rw mode at game launch
  - The WILD changes to layers
    - Pre hashes: layer 11133, NPC 1730
    - Post hashes, pre wild: 8975, 1803
    - Layer sets: layer 1186, NPC 1811-3000
  - Eliminating string comparisons
    - Hardware:
      - w/o hashes - layers 6679, NPCs 12145 // 5638, 2985
      - w/  hashes - layers 6400, NPCs 10252 // 5500, 3300
      - w/  sets   - layers   40, NPCs 10726 //   37, 3306
  - Load speeds (loading level)
  - NPC load: painful playground
  - Slow draw speed with many tiles
  - Lockup at beginning of world map??
    - Happens after all of the "newpaths" have finished
    - Seems to be saving
  - PGE_Delay??
  - 30fps lock??
  - New 3DS RAM...?
  - Allow user to disable sound?
  - Layers load: intro level of Mario Prime
    - FIXED!

    individual sound plays

  - Don't load OGGs on the main thread??? (if possible!)
    - Is there any way to speed up OGG loading?
  - Don't loop the P-button music
