  - Think through exceptions in standard library / PGE stuff

- Appearance glitches
  - Judder when Mario is on a conveyer belt
  - Judder when holding vegetable
  - MCZ judder

  - Bugs
    - Skeleton death anim (Hyrule temple)

- Performance
  - Eliminating string comparisons
    - 50% emu

    - Hardware:
      - w/o hashes - layers 6679, NPCs 12145 // 5638, 2985
