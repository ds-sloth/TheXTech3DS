SMBX Port to 3DS!

- Editor:
  - Allow delete thing to delete more than one square, but still one object per square

- Jupyter notebook
  - Easy. Upload mkromfs, tex3ds, install imagemagick and ffmpeg
  - unzip the user upload
  - run my script
  - let them download the resulting romfs folder zipped or romfs'd

- Work out CIA

- Graphics / graphical bugs
  - World map editor assets
  - Fix height of intro level
  - Provide any assets I have modified
  - Make icon for switch screens button
  - Make graphics for CIA

- Update credits
  - Person with 3DS OS thread (Mario 64) (see sound file for credit)
  - People who made opus tutorial
  - People who made citra, devkitpro
  - Fix credits music fadeout
    - (Means implementing music fadeouts in general)
  - Fix credits -> normal screen transition

- Understand why SD card access is so slow and do something about it

- Clear lower screen on editor exit

- Add cheats screen

- Sound
  - Think about tongue effect for flying boot... Why does it cutoff a little too late?
  - Music fadeins/fadeouts?
  - Make OGGs loop properly with that attribute Wohlstand likes

    - NON-ZERO DEFAULT GAIN?
  - Make the default 2612 emulator depend on the current CPU speed
  - Fix P-Switch music second play (has this been fixed?)
  - Fix credits music fadeout
  - Either make libgme run smoothly at O3DS speeds,
    or make both libgme and OGG easy options

- Alternative multiplayer controls

- Crashes
  - Almost entirely those silly blocking calls... D:

- Appearance glitches
  - Judder when Mario is on a conveyer belt
  - Judder when holding vegetable
  - MCZ judder
  - Improve rounding
    - Standard math round might be cheaper w optimizations
    - Sometimes tiled backgrounds desync (force them to round same way)

- Performance
  - WORLD MAP
  - Slow draw speed with many items
  - NPC load: painful playground
  - PGE_Delay??
  - New 3DS RAM...?
  - Allow user to disable sound
  - Even N3DS has somewhat poor performance in some levels (Dire Docks, last level).
    WHY?
